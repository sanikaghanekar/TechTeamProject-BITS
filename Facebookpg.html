<h2>How and Why do I associate with entrepreneurship?</h2>
<p>
<br>
I have always tried to find solutions to the day-to-day problems that I have faced. 
Entrepreneurship is finding solutions or a new lookout to already existing systems.
Being an entrepreneur requires a good idea but idea solely doesn't guarantee success.
Critical thinking, problem solving, team management and developing a small idea into a business is why I associate with entrepreneurship
